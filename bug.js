```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    This div should be red.
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    This div should be blue.
  </div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style two divs. However, if the parent div has a conflicting class that affects the background color, the child divs might not render with the correct colors. For example, if the parent div has `bg-gray-100`, both divs would have a gray background instead of red and blue. This happens due to Tailwind's utility-first approach. Although it offers great flexibility and reusability, it necessitates careful consideration of class specificity and potential conflicts.
